.container-fluid[
## Kubernetes

* Open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure.
* The project was started by Google in 2014.
* Heavily influenced by Google's Borg system
* Kubernetes **is not** a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS (Platform as a Service) system.
]

.container-fluid[
## Kubernetes

* Kubernetes is a framework for building distributed systems.
* v1.0 released on 21.7.2015 and donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
* Latest version v1.11 (28.6.2018)

* Greek for _Helmsman_; also the root of the words _governor_ and _cybernetic_.
* **K8s** is an abbreviation derived by replacing the 8 letters _ubernete_ with 8.

.container-fluid[
## Architecture

### The Kubernetes Node

#### `kubelet`

* The `kubelet` manages pods and their containers, their images, their volumes, etc.

#### `kube-proxy`

* A simple network proxy and load balancer.
* Can do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding (round robin) across a set of backends.
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Architecture

### The Kubernetes Control Plane

#### `etcd`

* Distributed reliable key-value store.

#### Kubernetes API Server

* Intended to be a CRUD-y server, with most/all business logic implemented in separate components or in plug-ins.
* Mainly processes REST operations, validates them, and updates the corresponding objects in `etcd` (and eventually other stores).

#### Scheduler

* Binds unscheduled pods to nodes.

#### Kubernetes Controller Manager Server

* All other cluster-level functions are currently performed by the Controller Manager.

## Pods

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* A group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared volumes.
* Containers witih a pod share an IP address and port space, and can find each other via `localhost`.
]
.col-sm-6[
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
spec:
  containers:
    image: nginx:1.7.9
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

.container-fluid[
## Labels

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* Key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods.
* Are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects.
* Can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects.
* Can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time.
]
.col-sm-6[
```
metadata:
  labels:
    release: stable
    environment: dev
    tier: frontend
    partition: customerA
    track: daily
```
]
]
]

.container-fluid[
## Annotations

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* Not used to identify and select objects.
* The metadata in an annotation can be small or large, structured or unstructured, and can include characters not permitted by labels.
]
.col-sm-6[
```
metadata:
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
```

.container-fluid[
## Label Selectors

* Via a *label selector*, the client/user can identify a set of objects.
* The API currently supports two types of selectors: *equality-based* and *set-based*.
* An empty label selector (that is, one with zero requirements) selects every object in the collection.
* A null label selector (which is only possible for optional selector fields) selects no objects.
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Label Selectors

### *Equality-based* requirements 

```
selector:
    component: redis
```

### *Set-based* requirements


```
selector:
  matchLabels:
    component: redis
  matchExpressions:
    - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache]}
    - {key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
```

.container-fluid[
## Replication Controllers

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* Ensures that a specified number of pod *replicas* are running at any one time.
* If there are too many pods, it will kill some.
* If there are too few, the replication controller will start more.
* The pods maintained by a replication controller are automatically replaced if they fail, get deleted, or are terminated.
]
.col-sm-6[
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx

## Replica Sets

* The next-generation Replication Controller.
* Replica Set supports the new set-based selector requirements.
* Can also be a target for Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA).

.container-fluid[
## Deployments

* Provides declarative updates for Pods and Replica Sets (the next-generation Replication Controller).
* A typical use case is:
  * Create a Deployment to bring up a Replica Set and Pods.
  * Check the status of a Deployment to see if it succeeds or not.
  * Later, update that Deployment to recreate the Pods (for example, to use a new image).
  * Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current Deployment isnâ€™t stable.
  * Pause and resume a Deployment.

.container-fluid[
## Services

* A Kubernetes `Service` is an abstraction which defines a logical set of `Pod`s and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called **a micro-service**. 
* The set of `Pod`s targeted by a `Service` is (usually) determined by a Label Selector.
* `kube-proxy` is responsible for implementing a form of virtual IP for `Service`s other than `ExternalName`.
* Kubernetes supports multiple port definitions on a `Service` object.
* Kubernetes supports 2 primary modes of finding a `Service`: 
  * environment variables (`MY_NGINX_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.162.149`, `MY_NGINX_SERVICE_PORT=80`),
  * DNS (`my-nginx.default.svc.cluster.local`).
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Services

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8765
      targetPort: 9376
  selector:
    app: example
```
]


---

.container-fluid[
## Services

* `ClusterIP`
  * Use a cluster-internal IP only.
  * Service to be reachable only from inside of the cluster.
* `NodePort`
  * On top of having a cluster-internal IP.
  * Expose the service on a port on each node of the cluster (the same port on each node).
* `LoadBalancer`
  * On top of having a cluster-internal IP and exposing service on a `NodePort` also, ask the cloud provider for a load balancer.
* `ExternalName`
  * Map the service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. `foo.bar.example.com`), by returning a `CNAME` record with its value.
  * No proxying of any kind is set up.

.container-fluid[
## Volumes

* A volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a pod.
* Has an explicit lifetime - the same as the pod that encloses it.
* Kubernetes supports many type of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously.
]

.container-fluid[
## Config Maps

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* The `ConfigMap` API resource holds key-value pairs of configuration data.
* Can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such as controllers. 
* `ConfigMap` is similar to Secrets, but designed to more conveniently support working with strings that do not contain sensitive information.
]
.col-sm-6[
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: default
data:
  special.how: very
  special.type: charm
```
]
]
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Config Maps

ConfigMaps can be used to:
1. Populate the value of environment variables.
2. Set command-line arguments in a container.
3. Populate config files in a volume.
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Config Maps

### Consume `ConfigMap` in environment variables

```
containers:
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
    command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
    env:
        - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            key: special.how
        - name: SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            key: special.type
```
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Config Maps

### Set command-line arguments with `ConfigMap`

```
containers:
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
    command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $(SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY) $(SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY)" ]

        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:

        - name: SPECIAL_TYPE_KEY
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            key: special.type
```
]

---

.container-fluid[
## Config Maps

### Consume `ConfigMap` via volume plugin


```

## Secrets

.row[
.col-sm-6[
* Are intended to hold sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys
* Kubernetes automatically creates secrets which contain credentials for accessing the API and it automatically modifies your pods to use this type of secret.
* Can be mounted as data volumes or be exposed as environment variables to be used by a container in a pod.
